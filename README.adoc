= https://isaqb.org[iSAQB] PDF Theme

This repository contains the *PDF theme* for iSAQB curricula and other official documents.

It contains <<copyrighted,copyrighted work>>.

== Applicability: What this repository is used for
The pdf theme (aka: _style_) can (and should) be used when converting documents written in AsciiDoc to pdf.


== How to use the style

=== Add the style to your repository

Add this repository as a submodule to your git repository containing by using the command:

   git submodule add https://github.com/isaqb-org/pdf-theme

*OR*

Clone or download the repository and copy the contents of the `/style` directory into the root of your repository.


=== Enable style in your build configuration

In your `*.gradle` file, add the following attributes to the task that inherits
from AsciidoctorTask (assuming that the folder `pdf-theme` is in your root folder):

```
      'pdf-stylesdir'    : '../pdf-theme/themes',
      'pdf-fontsdir'     : '../pdf-theme/fonts',
      'pdf-style'        : 'isaqb'
```


=== Title and cover page for your document
If you only use a single title for your document, it will be displayed on the cover page.
You can also define a subtitle, which will be displayed on the cover page as well, but with a different font style:

`= <This Is The Title>: <This Is The Subtitle>`

In the code of your document, you can define the following variable if you need a header text:

`:curriculum-header-title:` This text will be displayed in the header of the PDF.
